# TinyCompiler
## Tiny compiler ( Lexical analysis + Syntax Analyzer) implemented in a user-friendly GUI 
A QT-based project that serves in creating a tiny compiler that receives a percept of sentences, break them down into tokens according to tiny language grammar, and performs syntax analysis on each group of tokens to validate its integrity.

The compiler utilized in this implementation possesses advanced capabilities, akin to leading compilers employed globally, which allow it to not only identify but also display the generated errors. This feature enables developers to promptly detect and rectify any coding issues or inconsistencies. The compiler emulates the behavior of renowned compilers extensively utilized in the industry, ensuring compatibility and facilitating a smooth development process:
